I'm a full stack dev working on learning new things and creating new projects.
I work primarily in Python + Web stacks and have been doing some toying around with Rust and Go for a bit in my freetime.

If you want to chat about stuff you can always reach me on [keybase](https://keybase.io/stephenbunn/chat) or by [email](mailto:stephen@bunn.io).
