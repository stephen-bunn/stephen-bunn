<h1>Hey ðŸ‘‹ I'm Stephen</h1>

<p>
  I'm a "full-stack" dev who mainly uses free time to create small tools for myself.
  Most of my professional time has been spent working with Python, Rust, or various JS frontends.
  Mainly my experience has been focused on web development and internal engineering tools.
